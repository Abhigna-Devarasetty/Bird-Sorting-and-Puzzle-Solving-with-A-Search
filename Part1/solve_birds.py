# solve_birds.py : Bird puzzle solver

# Code by: Venkata Sai Abhigna Devarasetty - 2001103388
#
# Based on skeleton code by D. Crandall & B551 course staff, Fall 2022
#
# N birds stand in a row on a wire, each wearing a t-shirt with a number.
# In a single step, two adjacent birds can swap places. How can
# they rearrange themselves to be in order from 1 to N in the fewest
# possible steps?

#####
# THE ABSTRACTION:
#
# Initial state:

# Goal state:
# given a state, returns True or False to indicate if it is the goal state
def is_goal(state):
    return state == list(range(1, N+1))

# Successor function:
# given a state, return a list of successor states
def successors(state):
    return [ state[0:n] + [state[n+1],] + [state[n],] + state[n+2:] for n in range(0, N-1) ]

# Heuristic function:
# given a state, return an estimate of the number of steps to a goal from that state
def h(state):
    return 0

#########
#
# THE ALGORITHM:
#
# This is a generic solver using BFS. 
#
def solve(initial_state):
    fringe = []

    fringe += [(initial_state, []),]
    while len(fringe) > 0:
        (state, path) = fringe.pop(0)
        
        if is_goal(state):
            return path+[state,]

        for s in successors(state):
            fringe.append((s, path+[state,]))
